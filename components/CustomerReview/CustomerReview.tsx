                With the Nike Air Monarch IV everything fits so far, the upper material is of super quality and, above all, easy to clean. There is also a sole that is resistant and well padded thanks to the Nike Air system. The softly padded heel area also has a good support function for the foot and the laces used are of very high quality.
                <br />The only small point of criticism is the glue residue between the sole and the upper material, this could be done a little cleaner, but thatâ€™s nagging at a high level, the shoe itself has thrilled my husband again, especially because he was previously unsure whether to buy online does not cause major problems, e.g. if the shoes do not fit or press and have to be sent back.
